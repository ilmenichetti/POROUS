\arguments{
\item{My_mic}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{Mo_mic}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{My_mes}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{Mo_mes}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{gamma_o}{density of organic matter}

\item{f_agg}{an aggregation factor (m3 pore space mâˆ’3 organic matter) defined as the slope of the linear relationship assumed between the volume of aggregation pore space \eqn{V_{agg}}, and the volume of organic matter \eqn{V_{s_o}}}

\item{Delta_z_min}{minimal soil thickness if no organic matter was present}

\item{phi_min}{minimal porosity, user defined}

\item{phi_mac}{macroporosity}
}
\value{
one single value

\description{
This function calculates the matrix porosity \eqn{\phi_{mac}} based on the variation of organic matter in the soil. It is used in \code{\link{pore_frac}} to calculate mesoporosity \eqn{\phi_{mes}=\phi_{mat}-\phi_{mic}}
}
