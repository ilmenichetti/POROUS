\item{Mo_mic}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{My_mes}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{Mo_mes}{One of the four model pools (they are all summed up in this function for calculating the total)}

\item{gamma_o}{density of organic matter}

\item{f_agg}{an aggregation factor (m3 pore space mâˆ’3 organic matter) defined as the slope of the linear relationship assumed between the volume of aggregation pore space \eqn{V_{agg}}, and the volume of organic matter \eqn{V_{s_o}}}

\item{clay}{fraction of clay content}

\item{Delta_z_min}{minimal soil thickness if no organic matter was present}

one single value
}
\description{
This function calculates the microporosity \eqn{\phi_{mic}} based on the variation of organic matter in the soil. It is used in \code{\link{pore_frac}}
